Using the methodology described on Basketball Reference, I created some R code to obtain the SPS projections on the site. I wanted to use them in combination with other projections to get values for fantasy basketball but the projections are posted on the site very close to the beginning of the season so I decided to create my own. 

The projections produced are similar but not the exact same as the ones eventually produced on the site, I wasn't able to determine what the difference was (and frankly, didn't really care that much). The data uploaded is just downloaded from basketball-reference.com.
